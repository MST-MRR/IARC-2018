# Flight - 2018 IARC

#### Approach Overview

After our failures at the 2017 competition and our talks with other teams, we discovered that most teams were faking a transmitter. Rather than fancier methods, they simply used a PID Controller and RC Channel overrides to achieve a desired result.

#### Terms Overview

* [RC Channel Overrides](http://python.dronekit.io/examples/channel_overrides.html)
  * This is a technique in which you directly tell ArduPilot a transmitter value for a given function. The channels govern each available axis/function, there is a channel that maps to throttle control, roll, pitch, and yaw. You are essentially faking a transmitter. It is considered especially dangerous to utilize this technique because then a real, physical transmitter cannot send values for the channels you override. For instance, if you send a value for the throttle, then the actual transmitter loses the ability to control the throttle on the vehicle.
